Question:
What are the characteristics of living organisms?
Answer:
There are 7 characteristics of living organisms: Movement, Respiration, Sensitivity, Growth, Reproduction, Excretion, Nutrition.
Here's a funny way to memorize it. Think of it as MRS GREN. Easy, simple, and funny, right?

Here's the meaning of each one:

- Movement: All organisms can move (change their position or place) to some extent. Most animals can move their own body, while plants only move parts of themselves slowly. They can't move their whole body. That's why you won't see plants walking around your house! 🤣
- Respiration: Breaking down glucose to release energy
- Sensitivity: Picking up (noticing) changes in their environment (called stimuli; singular is stimulus) and responding to them
- Growth: All organisms increase in size and dry mass, either by growth of their existing cells, or by building new cells
- Reproduction: Making new organisms of the same species as themselves. (Example: humans make more humans, lions make more lions, and so on.)
- Excretion: Removal of unwanted/toxic waste products produced by their metabolic reactions (In a simple way, going to the bathroom. 🤣)
- Nutrition: Taking substances from environment to provide energy and materials to build new cells. (Just a fancy way to say "eating food and drinking water". LOL.)

Question:
How do organisms move?
Answer:
All organisms move, but not in the way you would expect.

Most animals are able to change their place from somewhere to another, moving their whole bodies to reach a destination. Common examples are horses, lions, or fish.
There are some exceptions, though. Some animals, such as sea anemones, aren't able to move their whole bodies from a place to another. However, they are able to move parts of their bodies, which still counts as movement.
Plants are similar to sea anemones. They only move parts of their bodies very slowly. The reason why they're able to move is in Chapter 12: Coordination and Response, so I won't delve into much detail here. 😅
Any other questions? I'd like to help! 🙂

Question:
What is glucose?
Answer:
You'll learn more about glucose in Chapter 4: Biological Molecules, but since you're curious, here are a bunch of simple points about glucose:

- Glucose is a carbohydrate, consisting of 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.
- It's a simple sugar obtainable from food we eat.
- It is used to produce energy to perform metabolic reactions in cells.

Would you like help in anything else? 😊

Question:
What is reproduction?
Answer:
Reproduction means making new organisms of the same species as the parent organisms. In a short way, making babies. 😅
Here are a few important points about reproduction:

- Reproduction can happen between organisms in the same species to produce an fertile offspring (baby that will be able to reproduce when he/she grows up) of the same species:
- For example, if both parents are horses ( Equus caballus ), then the offspring will be a fertile horse, an Equus caballus.
- Reproduction can also happen between similar species (organisms of different species but same genus). The result would be an infertile offspring.
- For example, you breed a male donkey ( Equus asinus ) and a female horse ( Equus caballus ) together. Since they have the same genus ( Equus ), they will reproduce, but they will produce a mule (Its scientific name is Equus asinus + Equus caballus, by the way. It doesn't have a scientific name of its own.)

You'll learn more about methods of reproduction in plants and animals in Chapter 14: Reproduction in Plants, and Chapter 15: Reproduction in Humans.

Question:
What is sensitivity?
Answer:
Sensitivity means picking up changes in the environment (stimuli, singular is stimulus) and responding to them.
Here's an example:

- Stimulus: your little brother tries to punch you
- Your eyes see your little brother aiming a fist at you
- You respond to the stimulus by dodging the shot.

Simple, right? 👍
If you want more details, you could check out Chapter 12: Coordination and Response!
Any other way I could help? 😊

Question:
What is nutrition?
Answer:
Nutrition means taking substances from the environment to provide energy and materials to build new cells or grow existing ones. It basically means
getting food to grow up muscles so you can take revenge on your little brother for punching you. 🤣 (Just don't write that one in a past paper, OK? Write the first one, please, or you'll get cooked. 🫣)
Animals get nutrition by eating other organisms, either plants, animals, or fungi. (think about mushrooms 🍄). This is covered in more detail in Chapter 7: Human Nutrition.
Plants get water from the soil to produce their own food using light energy.
This is covered in more detail in Chapter 6: Plant Nutrition.
Anything else? I'm here to help! 🙂

Question:
What is growth?
Answer:
Growth is a permanent increase in size and dry mass. All organisms grow, either by building new cells or increasing the size, or length, of existing cells in the body.

Our bodies use nutrients obtained from food to provide energy to grow, or to build new cells. This is known as nutrition.
Dry mass is the mass of an organism after it has been killed and all water removed from it. Sounds brutal, right? That's why we only measure dry mass in plants, since we don't want to murder humans. 😅
In a simpler way, think of dry mass as the mass of a dried plant. It's dead, and it doesn't have water inside it, so we grab it and use a balance to measure its mass in grams (or kilograms if it's a big plant.), and the balance shows the dry mass.
Anything else? I'd love to help you! 😀

Question:
What is excretion?
Answer:
Excretion is the removal of unwanted or toxic waste products produced by metabolic reactions in the body or by excessive intake of nutrients.
Basically, think of it as going to the bathroom.
An example of a toxic waste product is urea, which is released in the form of urine.
An unwanted nutrient could be water or salts, especially if you drink too much water or eat too much fast food. When this happens, water and salts that the body doesn't need are excreted with the urea. Water + salts + urea = urine.
You'll learn more about excretion in Chapter 13: Excretion and Homeostasis.
Anywhere else I could help in? Happy to help! 😄

Question:
What is respiration?
Answer:
Great question! Many people confuse between "respiration" and "breathing", and sometimes use them interchangeably. Here's the difference:

- Breathing is when you breathe air using your lungs.
- Respiration is using that oxygen you breathe to break down glucose
to provide energy for the cells in your body.

You'll learn more about respiration in Chapter 11: Respiration and Gas Exchange. If you're curious, you could check it out!
Do you need more assistance? 🙂

Question:
What is movement?
Answer:
Movement is the ability of an organism (or part of its body) to change its position or place.
All organisms move, but not in the way you would expect.

Most animals are able to change their place from somewhere to another, moving their whole bodies to reach a destination. Common examples are horses, lions, or fish.

There are some exceptions, though. Some animals, such as sea anemones, aren't able to move their whole bodies from a place to another. However, they are able to move parts of their bodies, which still counts as movement.
Plants are similar to sea anemones. They only move parts of their bodies very slowly. The reason why they're able to move is in Chapter 12: Coordination and Response, so I won't delve into much detail here. 😅

Question:
What is the biological classification system?
Answer:
The biological classification system is a method of putting living organisms into groups, depending on how closely biologists think the organisms are related to each other. They try to link living organisms to common ancestors that existed in the past.

A common ancestor is a species that lived in the past, and is thought to have given rise to several different species alive today.

Here's an example demonstrating the biological classification system (These aren't real animals, by the way. Just an example. 😂):

- Let's say we have Animal A, which existed more than 200 million years ago.
- Throughout the years, Animal A kept evolving, until it developed to 2 similar animals, Animal B1 and Animal B2, which existed a 100 million years ago.
- Animal B1 evolved until it developed into another 2 similar animals, Animal C1 and Animal C2, which existed 50 million years ago. Animal B2 went extinct before it evolved.
- Animal C1 evolved into Animal D1, which is present till now. Animal C2 evolved into Animal D2 and Animal D3, which are both still present.

All these animals are connected, since they all evolved from Animal A. In this example, Animal A is their common ancestor. (also known as the animal who started all this mess 🤣🤣🤣)
That's it for this topic. Anywhere else I could help? 😀
(By the way, you owe me $5 for making you laugh. Pay up. 🤣🤣🤣 Just joking. Good luck with your studying!)

Question:
What is a species?
Answer:
A species is the smallest group into which biologists classify living organisms.

Here's the CIE answer to this question:

- A species is a group of organisms that can reproduce to produce fer
tile offspring

That's the answer you should write in exams if a question asks you "Define the word 'species'.". (That question is worth 2 marks, by the way, so memorize that definition like your life depends on it, because honestly, it kinda does. 😅)

Humans are a species. Horses are a species. Every organism around you is a species.

Here's a note: the word "species" is both singular & plural (Sorry for giving you an English lesson, but you have to understand this. 😅)

- You could say "A human is a species."
- You could also say "Donkeys and horses are similar species."
Just don't write "specieses" please. (🤣) It's only "species". There's no plural version for this word.

Anyway, out of the English lesson. Here's more stuff about species (Biology
stuff this time. 🤣):
- Organisms of the same species could reproduce to produce a fertile organism of the same species.
- A horse and another horse reproduce to produce a baby horse that can reproduce when it grows up.
- Organisms of similar species (same genus, but different species) can reproduce to produce an infertile offspring of neither species
- A donkey and a horse can reproduce, but they won't produce a donkey or a horse. Instead, they'll produce a mule, which doesn't reproduce.

In the past part, I just mentioned same genus, but different species. 

What's a genus, then?

A genus is simply a group of similar species, with similar features, that can reproduce with each other to produce infertile offspring of neither species. That's it! Simple, right?

Sorry for the long message. It's just that each point connected to another, so I had to explain all the points at once.

Anything else? I'm willing to help! 🙂

Question:
What is the binomial naming system?
Answer:
The binomial naming system is a system of naming species that is internationally agreed, in which the scientific name for each species is made up of 2 parts: the genus, followed by the species. It's called so because the scientific name of an organism consists of 2 names (The prefix "bi" means two! The rest of the word, "nomial", comes from the word "name"!)

Here are a few examples:

- Human --> "Homo" (genus), followed by "sapiens" (species)

- Horse --> "Equus" (genus), followed by "caballus" (species)
- Donkey --> "Equus" (genus), followed by "asinus" (species)

Here are a few rules you should focus on when dealing with questions related to this system (This thing comes in past paper questions, you know. 😏):

- The first word (the genus) must start with a capital (uppercase) letter.
- The second word (The species) must start with a small (lowercase) letter.
- No abbreviations, please!
- Scientific names must be written in an italic font. If inapplicable (for example: you don't know how to write in italic), the scientific name should be underlined!

That's it! Anywhere else I could help? 😄

Question:
What's a dichotomous key?
Answer:
A dichotomous key is a way of identifying an organism by working through pairs of contradicting statements that lead you to its name.

Here's an example for a dichotomous key:

- Jointed limbs? --> Go to pair 2

No jointed limbs? --> Earthworm

- 5 or more pairs of jointed limbs? --> Centipede

Less than 5 pairs of jointed limbs? --> Go to pair 3

- 1st pair forms large claws? --> Crab

No large claws? --> Go to pair 4

- 3 pairs of limbs? --> Locust

4 pairs of limbs? --> Spider

You have to go through the statements one by one, starting from the top, until you reach the organism's name.

Question:
How many kingdoms are there, and what are they?
Answer:
Great question! There are 5 kingdoms in which living organisms are classified. Living organisms can be either animals, plants, fungi, protoctists, or prokaryotes.

Here are the main features that classify each kingdom:

- Animals
- Most animals move actively. (Some don't move much, such as sea anemones.)
- Their cells have a nucleus.
- Their cells don't have cell walls or chloroplasts.
- They feed on organic (Carbon-containing) substances made by other living organisms.
- Multicellular

- Plants
- Usually have roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. (Some don't have them, such as ferns, mosses, and liverworts.)
- Their cells have a nucleus, a cell wall (made of cellulose), and chloroplasts (responsible for the green colour of leaves; you'll learn more about chloroplasts in Chapter 2: Cells, and Chapter 6: Plant Nutrition.)
- They feed by photosynthesis. (You'll also learn more about this in Chapter 6: Plant Nutrition.)
- Also multicellular

- Fungi
- Their body mainly consists of hyphae (microscopic threads of cells arranged beside each other)
- Their cells have cell walls. (not made from cellulose)
- Usually decomposers. (I think you learnt that in Grade 5, right? 🤣)
- They're mostly multicellular, with yeast being the only exception, since it's a unicellular fungus.
- They reproduce by forming spores. (Clusters of cells inside a tough protein coating)

- Protoctists
- Some are unicellular, and some are multicellular.
- In terms of cell structure, some are animal-like (They have cells similar to animal cells.), some are plant-like (Cells similar to plants.), and some are fungus-like (Cells similar to fungi)
- Common features of them are cilia (little hairs used for movement. An example for that is in a Paramecium), and flagella (singular is a flagellum; a tail used for movement; an example for that is in a Chlamydomonas)

- Prokaryotes
- They don't have a nucleus. Instead, they have a main strand of DNA floating in the cytoplasm of the cell, and small circular loops of DNA called plasmids.
- They are usually unicellular (one cell only)
- They have a cell wall not made of cellulose (If you're curious, it's made of peptidoglycan. 😉)
- They have a cytoplasm, but all that it contains are the main strand of
DNA, the plasmids, and ribosomes.
- They have a capsule covering the cell wall, as extra protection from threats
- They have flagella.
- The most common example is bacteria.

Sorry for the long answer. I hope my explanation helps with your studies! 😀

Question:
What are animals?
Answer:
Animals are a kingdom of the 5 kingdoms in which all living organisms are classified. Examples are horses, lions, birds, and even humans.
Here are the main features of animals:

- Most animals move actively in search of food. However, some animals, such as sea anemones and lazy humans (🤣) don't move much.
- Their cells have a nucleus inside them, which controls the cell's activities. You'll learn more about nuclei in Chapter 2: Cells.
- Their cells don't have a cell wall or chloroplasts.
- They feed on organic (Carbon-containing) substances made by other living organisms.

There are 5 types of animals: fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.

That's all for now. Hope this helps! ☺

Question:
What are plants?
Plants are a kingdom of the 5 kingdoms in which all living organisms are classified. Plants are everywhere in our lives, but you'll mainly recognize them in fruits, vegetables, and salads!
Here are the main features of plants:

- They usually have roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. However, some plants, such as ferns, mosses, and liverworts, don't have some of these.
- Their cells have a nucleus inside them, which controls the cell's activities.
- Their cells have cell walls protecting the cell and keeping it intact.
- Their cells have chloroplasts, which absorb light energy to create food in a process called photosynthesis. You'll learn more about this in Chapter 2: Cells, as well as Chapter 6: Plant Nutrition!

There are 2 types of plants: ferns, and flowering plants.

Anything else? I'm happy to help! 😀

Question:
What are fungi?
Answer:
Fungi are a kingdom of the 5 kingdoms in which all living organisms are classified. The most common examples of fungi are mushrooms and yeast.
Here are some common features of fungi:

- The majority of their body consists of hyphae. (microscopic threads of cells arranged in order beside each other.)
- Fungi are mostly multicellular, with yeast being the only exception, since it's only 1 cell.
- They are usually decomposers. (You should've taken this in Grade 5. 🤣)
- They reproduce by forming spores. (clusters of cells inside tough protein coating.)

That's it for fungi! Anything else? 😊

Question:
What are protoctists?
Answer:
Protoctists are a kingdom of the 5 kingdoms in which all living organisms are classified. Protoctists are very uncommon, since you can't usually see them, so it's hard to provide examples.
Here are some common features of protoctists:

- Protoctists are a mystery. Some are multicellular, while others are multicellular.
- They don't have a specific structure of their own. Animal-like protoctists have similar cells to animals. Plant-like protoctists have similar cells to plants. Fungi-like protoctists have similar cells to fungi.
- They have various methods to help them move. Some have cilia attached to their cell membrane. Cilia are tiny little hair that sweep back and forth (think of a broom 🧹) to push the cell forward. Others have flagella (singular is flagellum). A flagellum is a small tail (bigger than cilia) that pushes the cell forward. Think of a flagella as a boat's mo
tor engine.

That's all for protoctists. I'm ready to answer all your questions! 😄

Question:
What are prokaryotes?
Answer:
Prokaryotes are a kingdom of the 5 kingdoms in which living organisms are classified. The prokaryote kingdom contains a huge amount of organisms, but we are often unaware of them. A common example of prokaryotes is a bacterium.

Prokaryotes have cells that are very different from the cells of organisms in
any other kingdom. Here's why:

- They don't have a nucleus. Instead, they have a main strand of DNA floating in the cytoplasm, as well as other smaller DNA loops called plasmids.
- They have cell walls, but they aren't made of cellulose. (If you're curious, it's called peptidoglycan.)
- They don't have mitochondria. (Yet they somehow still live long enough to give us diseases somehow LOL.)
- They typically have a flagellum, which they use for movement.
- They have a capsule covering the cell wall, to protect the bacterium from our immune systems.
- Most importantly, they're all unicellular.

That's all for prokaryotes. Anywhere else I could help?

Question: 
What are vertebrates?
Answer:
Vertebrates are animals which have backbones. These are the animals that we encounter most in our lives. There are 5 types of vertebrates:

- Fish
- Amphibians
- Reptiles
- Birds
- Mammals

Anything else? Happy to help!

Question: 
What are fish?
Answer:
Fish are a form of vertebrates, animals that have a backbone, which all live in water (except a few species which could come onto land for short periods).
Here are some typical characteristics of fish:

- They are vertebrates with scaly skin
- They have gills throughout their lives
- They have fins
- Their eggs have no shells and are laid in water.

That's all for fish. Hope this helps!

Question: 
What are amphibians?
Answer:
Amphibians are a form of vertebrates, animals that have a backbone, which mostly live on land. Common examples are frogs, toads, and salamanders.

Here's the life cycle of an amphibian:

- Adult amphibians lay eggs in water which have no shells
- Larvae, called tadpoles (baby amphibians) emerge from the egg.
- They spend their lives as tadpoles underwater.
- They later undergo metamorphosis, a major change in the shape and size of their bodies, to become adults
- When metamorphosis is complete, they become adult amphibians and they live on land.

Here are some typical amphibian characteristics:

- They are vertebrates with smooth, non-scaly skin
- Their eggs have no shells and are laid in water
- The tadpoles live in water, while adults live on land
- Tadpoles have lungs and fins, while adults have lungs and legs.

That's it! Happy to help! Good luck with your studies!

Question: 
What are reptiles?
Answer:
Reptiles are a form of vertebrates, animals that have a backbone, which all live on land. Common examples are crocodiles, snakes, and turtles. In fact, dinosaurs were actually reptiles before they were extinct.

Here are their characteristics:

- They have scaly skin, and they have lungs as they live on land
- They don't need to breed underwater like fish or amphibians, as they lay eggs with a soft waterproof shell preventing them from drying out.

See? Pretty simple, right? Anyway, happy to help!

Question: 
What are birds?
Answer:
Birds are a form of vertebrates which have evolved from dinosaurs. They have a lot of characteristics, including some shared with reptiles.

Here are some of their characteristics:

- They sometime have scaly skin like reptiles, but only on their legs
- They lay eggs with shells on land, just like reptiles. However, birds' eggs have hard shells, unlike reptiles, which lay eggs with soft shells.
- They have feathers and a beak (their 2 most distinctive features)
- Their front 2 limbs are wings (However, some birds, such as ostriches, can't fly.)
- They have the ability to control their body temperature
- They have a heart with 4 chambers. (Fish, amphibians, and reptiles only have 2 or 3 in their hearts)

Wow. That was shorter than expected, right? Now get back to homework!

Question: 
What are mammals?
Answer:
Mammals are the most common vertebrates, and they're the biggest group of vertebrates. Humans, in fact, are mammals!

Some features of mammals are actually shared with birds, such as their ability to control their body temperature, or their hearts, which both have 4 chambers in them.

However, mammals have lots of distinctive features, such as:

- Their skin has hair
- Their ears have a pinna (ear flap) on the outside
- They have different kinds of teeth (incisors, canines, premolars, and molars)
- Their young develop in a uterus attached to the mother by a placenta
- The females have mammary glands which produce milk to feed their young
- They have sweat glands in their skin
- They have a diaphragm (a muscle separating the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity, which helps with breathing)

That was a long one. Good luck studying that!

Question: 
What are the groups within the plant kingdom?
Answer:
There are 2 groups within the plant kingdom, each with their own characteristics:

- Ferns
- Flowering plants, split into both monocotyledons (monocots) and dicotyledons (dicots)

That's just a simple overview. Want a deep dive? Just ask me!

Question: 
What are ferns?
Answer:
Ferns are a form of plants which have leaves called fronds.
They don't produce flowers. Instead, they reproduce by spores (clusters of cells protected by a thick hard shell). They are usually seen on the underside of the fronds.
They have roots and stems, but they're usually quite small. However, some species can reach heights of up to 20 metres tall.

That's it! Happy to help!

Question: 
What are flowering plants?
Answer:
These are the plants that are most familiar to us.
They reproduce by producing flowers. (Obviously.)

Here are their common characteristics:

- They have roots, stems, and leaves.
- They reproduce using flowers and seeds.
- Their seeds are produced inside an ovary inside the flower.

They are split into 2 groups: monocotyledons and dicotyledons.

But what are these?
The seeds of flowering plants have leaves called cotyledons, and the amount of leaves they have determines the structure of the plant.

Monocots have only 1 cotyledon, so they have:

- Flower parts (petals and leaves) in multiples of 3
- Parallel leaf veins
- Branching root system (many small roots)

Dicots, however, have 2 cotyledons, so they have:

- Flower parts in multiples of 4 or 5
- Network of leaf veins
- Main root with other smaller roots branching from it.

That's all! Any other questions?

Question: 
What are viruses?
Answer:
Viruses are objects that cause illness to us. They cause common diseases such as colds and influenza, as well as more serious ones such as AIDS.

They aren't considered as living organisms, though, since they don't show any of the 7 characteristics of living organisms until they get inside a living cell, and even then, it could only reproduce inside a cell. Nothing else.

How do they reproduce then? They:

- Take over the cell's organelles
- The cell organelles are forced to make multiple copies of the virus
- The new viruses cause the cell to burst and die
- The new viruses invade other cells and repeat the process

That's it! Anything else? I'm ready to help!

Question: 
What are viruses made of?
Answer:
The virus's structure is simple: just a piece of genetic material (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat.
We can never see them just with our eyes, as they're so tiny we use a scale of nanometres (A nanometre is 1 x 10^-9 cm, by the way).
